## ⚙️ Configuration

The system is highly configurable through `shared/config.lua`. Key sections:

### UI Configuration
```lua
Config.UI = {
    EnableLedgerApp = true,
    MapOverlay = true,
    StatusIcons = true,
    PhotoCatalog = true,
    AuctionUI = true,
    DiscordWebhooks = true,
    VoiceCommands = {
        enable = true,
        whistleDog = true,
        callCattle = true
    }
}
```

### Environment Settings
```lua
Config.Environment = {
    SeasonLengthMinutes = 120,  -- How long each season lasts
    SeasonSequence = { "spring", "summer", "autumn", "winter" },
    -- Weather patterns, hazards, wildlife, soil, water...
}
```

### Economy Settings
```lua
Config.Economy = {
    DynamicPricing = {
        baseDemand = { beef = 1.0, milk = 1.0, wool = 1.0 },
        seasonalModifiers = {
            winter = { beef = 1.3, milk = 1.1 }
        }
    },
    Contracts = {
        maxActive = 5,
        townBoards = { "Valentine", "Rhodes", "Blackwater" }
    }
}
```

### Livestock Configuration
```lua
Config.Livestock = {
    cattle = {
        needsDecayPerHour = { hunger = 0.15, thirst = 0.2 },
        breedingCooldownDays = 60,
        gestationDays = 9
    }
    -- ... more species settings
}
```

For complete configuration options, see `shared/config.lua`.

---

## 🔧 Customization

### Changing UI Keybind

Edit `client/ui.lua`:
```lua
RegisterKeyMapping('ranchui', 'Open Ranch UI', 'keyboard', 'F5')  -- Change F5 to your preferred key
```

### Customizing UI Colors

Edit `html/css/style.css`:
```css
:root {
    --primary-bg: rgba(20, 15, 10, 0.95);
    --accent-color: #d4a574;  -- Change to your preferred color
    /* ... */
}
```

### Adding Custom Livestock Species

Edit `shared/config.lua`:
```lua
Config.Livestock.yourspecies = {
    needsDecayPerHour = { hunger = 0.1, thirst = 0.15 },
    breedingCooldownDays = 30,
    -- ... your settings
}
```

### Discord Webhook Integration

Configure in `shared/config.lua`:
```lua
Config.Discord = {
    WebhookUrl = "your_webhook_url_here",
    AlertChannelId = "channel_id",
    TransferRoleOnSale = true
}
```

## 📊 Data Storage

By default, the system uses JSON file storage:

- `data/ranches.json` - Ranch ownership and metadata
- `data/animals.json` - Livestock registry
- `data/workforce.json` - Worker rosters
- `data/economy.json` - Market prices and contracts
- `data/environment.json` - Season and weather state
- `data/progression.json` - XP and achievements
- `data/production.json` - Processing chains
- `data/vegetation.json` - Pasture and vegetation data

### Migrating to MySQL

To use MySQL instead of JSON:

1. Install [oxmysql](https://github.com/overextended/oxmysql)
2. Edit `server/storage.lua`
3. Replace JSON read/write functions with SQL queries
4. Create database tables based on JSON structure

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### UI Not Opening

**Problem:** Pressing F5 does nothing

**Solutions:**
1. Check console for errors: `[RanchUI] Ranch UI Client loaded successfully`
2. Verify resource is running: `/ensure omni_ranch`
3. Check fxmanifest.lua includes all files
4. Clear cache and restart

### NUI Focus Issues

**Problem:** Can't click UI elements or can't close UI

**Solutions:**
1. Press `ESC` multiple times
2. Use `/ranchui` command to toggle
3. Check browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors
4. Restart resource: `/restart omni_ranch`

### Missing Data in UI

**Problem:** Livestock/workforce shows "Loading..."

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure you have ranch data (create ranch first)
2. Check server console for data sync errors
3. Verify JSON files exist in `data/` folder
4. Check file permissions on JSON files

### Permission Denied

**Problem:** Admin commands don't work

**Solutions:**
1. Add your license to `Config.Admin.Identifiers`
2. Or grant ACE: `add_ace group.admin ranch.admin allow`
3. Restart server after config changes
4. Check identifier format (license:, citizenid:, discord:, etc.)

### UI Display Issues

**Problem:** UI looks broken or misaligned

**Solutions:**
1. Clear browser cache: `/resmon` and check NUI memory
2. Check console for CSS loading errors
3. Verify all HTML/CSS/JS files are in correct locations
4. Test with different screen resolution

## 🤝 Integration with Other Resources

### Framework Compatibility

This resource is framework-agnostic by default but can integrate with:

- **RedM Reborn** - Use `GetPlayerData()` for character info
- **RedEM:RP** - Integrate with job system
- **VORP** - Connect to VORP character and inventory
- **QBCore RedM** - Use QBCore player functions

### Example Integration (VORP)

```lua
-- In client/ui.lua, modify openRanchUI():
local VORPcore = {}
TriggerEvent("getCore", function(core)
    VORPcore = core
end)

local User = VORPcore.getUser()
local Character = User.getUsedCharacter
ranchData.ranchName = Character.firstname .. "'s Ranch"
```
